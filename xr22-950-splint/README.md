# XR22-950-3A

An Arduino sketch to fix the behavior of the XR22-950-3A chip in the Vector Graphic 4 keyboard.

It listens to the 4 control pins (ABCD) and sends a pulse on the corresponding output pin
for the broken output pins on my XR22-950-3A.

NOTE: this is specific to MY XR22-950-3A; yours may have different failures.
